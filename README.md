Character Replacer Coding Challenge
=======================

### About
This program is written in Node and uses ES6 syntax via Babel.  Tests are written using the Mocha testing framework.

It parses a text file and replaces each word with the following criteria: 1st letter, number of unique characters between the first and last character and the last letter.  Words are separated by non-alphabetic characters.

When run, the app logs out the results in the console.
